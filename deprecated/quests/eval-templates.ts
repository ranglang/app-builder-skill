          Create an app that shows 20 balls bouncing inside a spinning heptagon:

          All balls have the same radius.
          All balls have a number on it from 1 to 20.
          All balls drop from the heptagon center when starting.
          Colors are: #f8b862, #f6ad49, #f39800, #f08300, #ec6d51, #ee7948, #ed6d3d, #ec6800, #ec6800, #ee7800, #eb6238, #ea5506, #ea5506, #eb6101, #e49e61, #e45e32, #e17b34, #dd7a56, #db8449, #d66a35
          The balls should be affected by gravity and friction, and they must bounce off the rotating walls realistically. There should also be collisions between balls.
          The material of all the balls determines that their impact bounce height will not exceed the radius of the heptagon, but higher than ball radius.
          All balls rotate with friction, the numbers on the ball can be used to indicate the spin of the ball.
          The heptagon is spinning around its center, and the speed of spinning is 360 degrees per 5 seconds.
          The heptagon size should be large enough to contain all the balls.
          Use React and HTML5 Canvas for rendering; implement collision detection algorithms and collision response etc. by yourself. Do not use any external libraries besides React and standard JavaScript"`,
